handler routes like /podcasts from outside of app with node js and express js
warn user if there is missing params in request to api 
also check for types in api params
custom_ajax.js make sure about if it handles everything correct or not (i think it wont)
care about todo s which are inside code => for example i have used temp dir of windows in codes of uploading file
but maybe this project be published on a linux server (most probably)
